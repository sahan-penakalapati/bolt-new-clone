# Project Timeline & Context

## Timeline

### March 19, 2024

- Initial project setup with Next.js, TypeScript, and Vitest
- Implemented base agent framework structure
- Created initial test suite
- LEARNINGS:
  - Need to use python venv in ./venv for tools
  - Include debug info in program output
  - Always read file before editing
  - For git commits with Cursor, use file for multiline messages and include "[Cursor]" prefix

### Current State (March 19, 2024)

#### What's Working

1. Project Structure

   - Next.js + TypeScript setup complete
   - Agent framework base classes defined
   - Test infrastructure with Vitest in place

2. Core Components Implemented
   - BaseAgent class with lifecycle management
   - MessageQueue for agent communication
   - AgentRegistry for managing agent instances
   - Basic agent types (Orchestrator, ESLint, Deployment, Compatibility)

#### What's Not Working

1. Test Suite Status

   - 44 failing tests across multiple components
   - Major issues in MessageQueue implementation
   - State management problems in BaseAgent
   - Agent Registry limits not enforced
   - Timeout handling issues

2. Known Bugs
   - Message priority ordering not working
   - Queue size limits not enforced
   - Processing state tracking incorrect
   - State transitions during message processing failing
   - Error recovery mechanisms not functioning

#### Current Priorities

1. Fix core message handling

   - Message Queue implementation
   - Priority ordering
   - Processing state management

2. Fix state management
   - BaseAgent state transitions
   - Error handling
   - Timeout mechanisms

#### Key Technical Details

- Node.js version: v23.6.0
- Test framework: Vitest
- TypeScript: Strict mode enabled
- Python venv: Required for tools

#### Learnings & Mistakes to Avoid

1. Implementation Issues

   - Don't initialize MessageQueue without process callback
   - Always handle state transitions in try/finally blocks
   - Ensure proper cleanup in error cases
   - Validate message format before processing

2. Testing Issues
   - Tests timing out due to improper async handling
   - State transition tests need better setup
   - Mock timers not properly managed
   - Error cases not properly tested

#### Current Blockers

1. MessageQueue Implementation

   - Priority ordering broken
   - Processing state inconsistent
   - Queue size limits not working

2. Agent State Management
   - Incorrect state transitions
   - Timeout handling broken
   - Error recovery not working

#### Development Environment

- Required: Node.js 18.x or later
- Required: pnpm 8.x or later
- Required: Python venv in ./venv
- Required: Git

#### Tools Available

1. Python Tools
   - Screenshot verification
   - LLM API access
   - Web scraping
   - Search functionality

#### Next Immediate Steps

1. Fix MessageQueue implementation
2. Fix BaseAgent state management
3. Fix timeout handling
4. Fix agent registry limits

Note: This document reflects the actual implemented state, not the planned features. Many features mentioned in architecture.md and components.md are not yet implemented.
