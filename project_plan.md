## Understand the Core Features

Before writing any code, spend time clarifying what your "copy of bolt.new" should do. Bolt.new offers several main capabilities:

1. **AI-driven code generation**—Users input prompts to generate starter code for popular web frameworks and libraries.
2. **In-browser IDE**—A browser-based environment where you can write, edit, and view code outputs without local setup.
3. **Package installation and backends**—Options to manage npm packages or run Node.js processes directly in the browser.
4. **Deployment**—Simple deployment from the platform to hosting providers or via shareable URLs.

Your first step: Choose the initial subset of features you truly need (for example, AI code generation + a minimal in-browser editor).

## Chunk 1: Foundational Setup

1. **Pick Your Tech Stack**

   - Use a front-end framework like Next.js or React to display the interface[1].
   - Integrate a back-end or serverless approach for handling user sessions, if needed. If you want everything in-browser, consider WebContainers-like technology that runs Node.js in the browser.
   - Since you're familiar with Cursor, you can use it to generate an initial skeleton for your app.

2. **Create a Simple Web IDE**

   - Start with a code editor component in the browser (like a lightweight Monaco Editor or CodeMirror).
   - Focus on basic functionality for editing text and displaying output in an iframe or preview panel.

3. **Account System (Optional Initial Step)**
   - You can postpone user signups until later. If you need accounts from the start, integrate a lightweight authentication service (e.g., Supabase or Firebase) to manage user credentials[17].

Action items for this chunk:

- Use Cursor to scaffold a Next.js or React project with a basic code editor component.
- Test loading and editing some sample code, then display results in a preview panel.

---

## Chunk 2: AI Code Generation

1. **Choose Your AI Provider**

   - You can integrate an API from services like OpenAI or a model provided by your platform of choice[6].
   - The AI should respond to user prompts and return code suggestions or full files.

2. **Build Prompting Flow**

   - Implement a text input where users type requests.
   - Send user input to your AI endpoint to retrieve code suggestions.
   - Display the suggested code in the editor.

3. **Integrate AI in IDE Workflow**
   - Allow the user to accept or reject AI-generated code.
   - Provide toggles for different frameworks or extraction of code snippets vs. entire projects.

Action items for this chunk:

- Use Cursor to generate a backend route or serverless function that calls the AI API.
- Create a function that merges the AI's suggested code into your main editor.

---

## Chunk 3: In-Browser Execution

1. **WebContainers or Similar Technology**

   - Investigate WebContainers (StackBlitz's underlying tech) to run Node.js or command-line tasks directly in the browser[1][2].
   - If a direct WebContainer-like approach isn't feasible for now, consider simulating it with a server-based runner you can query via API for code execution.

2. **Package Installation**

   - Let users type commands or install dependencies from the UI, then reflect those changes in the environment[2][4].
   - If full in-browser package management is not viable yet, handle it on the server side, storing a user's package.json on the back end.

3. **Live Preview**
   - Provide a live preview that updates whenever the user modifies code.
   - If you want Node.js APIs or routes displayed in your preview, route them through your in-browser environment or a lightweight server.

Action items for this chunk:

- Test simpler commands (e.g., running "npm install package-name" from your app).
- Confirm you can compile or bundle user code and display it in a preview.

---

## Chunk 4: Deployment and Sharing

1. **One-Click Deployment**

   - Let users deploy to Netlify or another host with minimal steps[2][4].
   - Automate building the user's codebase and pushing it to the deployment service's API.

2. **Shareable URLs**

   - Allow each project or snippet to be accessible via unique URL.
   - Store project data in your database so that when users visit a shared URL, the code from that session or project is loaded and displayed.

3. **Consider a Freemium Model**
   - For a future stage, decide if you'll limit the number of AI prompts or private projects for free users[3].

Action items for this chunk:

- Implement a build-and-deploy script.
- Let the user click "Deploy" to run the script and get back a live link.

---

## Chunk 5: Polishing and Expansion

1. **Collaboration Features** (Optional but powerful)

   - Real-time multi-user editing, or the ability to invite collaborators into the same environment.

2. **Advanced Debugging**

   - Provide an AI-based "debugging assistant" that suggests fixes for errors it detects in the console[7].
   - Offer logs, breakpoints, or console output in the browser.

3. **Security & Scalability**
   - Plan how you'll handle malicious code attempts or resource-intensive processes in your in-browser environment.
   - Scale storage, CPU, or usage limits according to user demand.

Action items for this chunk:

- Rely on Cursor or another AI assistant to help generate code for advanced features.
- Gradually integrate real-time collaboration or project-based roles.

---

## Moving Forward

Focus on building a minimal but functional version of each chunk, in order:

1. **Chunk 1 (Foundational Setup)** – Basic editor and skeleton UI.
2. **Chunk 2 (AI Code Generation)** – Prompt-based code suggestions.
3. **Chunk 3 (In-Browser Execution)** – Code runs with installed packages.
4. **Chunk 4 (Deployment)** – One-click publish.
5. **Chunk 5 (Expansion)** – Additional collaboration or debugging features.

Don't try to do all of it in one pass. Build iteratively, test each component, and refine using Cursor for support in intermediate coding tasks. This approach lets you grow your app step by step, molding it into a more complete bolt.new clone over time.
